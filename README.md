This repository contains resources and data associated with the study of Richelia intracellularis and its evolutionary and metabolic adaptations to an obligate symbiotic lifestyle with diatoms.
The study highlights the genomic, phylogenomic, and metabolic features of R. intracellularis, offering new perspectives on host-symbiont interactions and nitrogen fixation in marine ecosystems.
The scripts here include the codes for pangenomic analysis on Anvio-8, extraction of sequences of interest, creation of fasta files for MSA analysis, generating phylogenetic tree baes on MSA and study of evolution of genes relate do nitrogen fixation.
